## Who i am
I explore the hidden layers of machines.
Between firmware an philosophy - I map what most overlook.
No noise, no spotlight. Just signal.

- Linux embedded tinkerer
- Firmware, initramfs, low-level systems
- Python â€¢ C â€¢ C++ â€¢ Bash
- Terminal aestethics & interactive fiction
- Documentation, structure and understanding

### Code Philosophy
> Systems are stories. Every bug is a plot twist,
> every signal a voice waiting to be understood.

I write code the same way I design worlds - with structure, intent and a touch of enigma.

### Connect
Not much to say, not much to show.
If you understand the silence between bytes - you already know where to find me.
